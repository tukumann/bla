# Some information about my experience
Hello! My name's Timofei. I'm web developer. I've started my long road in 2019 and since January 2021 I'm working as professional in IT-One company.
Mostly I'm working on frontend and sometimes make some business logic (via JSON) as well. 

My current working stack on Angular/Typescript, HTML, CSS/SASS, also I'm using Jest framework for unit testing.

Also, I'm creating some freelancing and pet projects using React/Redux with hooks, MongoDB, Node.js/Express and sometimes Nest.js.
